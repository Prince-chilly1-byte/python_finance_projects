This notebook contains code to obtain Markowitz's efficient frontier.
Efficient frontier contains all possible weights at a given risk and return
Points that lie on the tangent of the frontier are considered the most optimal portfolios
This is because for the same level of risk, with comparison with other portfolio combinations
the portfolio combinations have a higher return for that given risk.
It will make sense when you see the plot plot
to obtain the optimal or best portfolio conditions to meet certain clients' condition, i used 
Excel's Solver tool, i will post a the spreadsheet in the coming weeks, to illustrate the example
